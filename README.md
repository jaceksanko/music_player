## Design choices
I chose to ReactJS to render view and Redux to manage the state in an application. To write CSS I used preprocessor SASS and to write simple tests I used Jest with Enzyme.

I used create-react-app 
 [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a starter. 

## Instruction

In the project directory, you can run:
### `git clone https://github.com/jaceksanko/music_player.git`

Puts the app in your folder.

### `npm install`

Installs all dependencies. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
